This powerful tool not only encapsulates the current financial status but also provides a historical context, allowing users to delve into data dating back to 2010. The data presented here is crucial for understanding the intricate web of economic indicators that shape our daily lives. At the forefront of this dashboard are the Year to Date (YTD) figures, offering a real-time snapshot of key indicators that hold sway over our everyday experiences. These include the Exchange Rate, Petrol Price, Repo Rate, and Consumer Price Index. These metrics serve as vital benchmarks, influencing everything from our purchasing power to the cost of living. Delving deeper, the dashboard unfolds a visual narrative through graphs, portraying the quarterly performance of pivotal economic indicators. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), providing a macroscopic view of the overall economic health. Alongside, the Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) sheds light on the various components of spending within the economy. The Unemployment Rate, a critical socio-economic metric, finds its representation in these graphs, offering insights into the labor market dynamics. Furthermore, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) graph delineates the trends in investments made by businesses and the government, a key determinant of long-term economic growth.

## Monthly

The monthly tab shows the performance of some of the economic indicators highlited in the first tab. We can see the performance from January to June. Most of these indicators show small increases over time, showing gradual changes in the economy. But here's the interesting part: May stands out because it's the month where three important things hit their highest points â€“ the Exchange Rate, Petrol Price, and Repo Rate. The Exchange Rate tells us how strong our money is, and it's at its highest in May. The Petrol Price, which is connected to global oil prices, also reaches its peak during this month. The Repo Rate, a tool used by central banks to influence the economy, follows the same trend by hitting its highest point in May. 

Now, the big question is: Is there a connection between these three things? Does one affect the other? Investigating this could help us understand more about how our economy works. Since this picture only focuses on one year, when we filter for other years to see the trend, it is evident that May is not the problem but these fluncuations occur in any given month. This interesting situation in May invites experts to look closer and figure out if there's a reason behind these peaks. Is it just a coincidence, or is there a real relationship between the Exchange Rate, Petrol Price, and Repo Rate? Finding out could give us a better grasp of how our economy functions and help us be ready for future changes.

## Quarterly

The Quarterly Tab provides a dynamic platform for analyzing economic indicators on a year-on-year basis. These indicators include FHCE (Final Household Consumption Expenditure), GDE (Gross Domestic Expenditure), GCE (Government Consumption Expenditure), and GFCF (Gross Fixed Capital Formation). This tab is designed to offer insights into the performance of these key economic metrics, allowing users to make detailed assessments and comparisons. The primary focus of the Quarterly Tab is to display the year-on-year change for each quarter. Year-on-year analysis is crucial for understanding how economic indicators have evolved over time, providing a clear perspective on trends and patterns. By comparing corresponding quarters from different years, users can identify seasonal variations, cyclical trends, or significant shifts in economic activity.

## Yearly

The Annual Tab serves as a vital tool for conducting trend analysis, offering a comprehensive view of the time series for various economic indicators. It allows users to track the performance of these indicators over previous years, providing valuable insights into the overall economic trajectory. It is more of a trend analysis that shows how these indicators have perfomed over the previous years. Just to highlight a few indicators, 2022 recorded the highest unemployment rate in the unemployement rate time series. This key indicator sheds light on the labour market dynamics and signals challenges in job creation. Understanding the factors contributing to this peak in unemployment becomes crucial for policymakers and businesses alike. The data reveals a noteworthy trend in total investments as a percentage of GDP. In 2020, this metric hit its lowest point, indicating a potential economic downturn or disruption. However, the gradual upward trend observed post-2020 suggests a recovery in investment activities. This insight is pivotal for assessing economic resilience and the confidence of investors in subsequent years. An intriguing observation in the Annual Tab is the strong correlation between import and export volumes. This correlation implies a close interdependence between a nation's imports and exports, reflecting the interconnectedness of global trade. Understanding this relationship is crucial for trade policies, as changes in one may have implications for the other.

The visual representation of time series data in the Annual Tab enhances clarity and facilitates better decision-making. Trends and patterns become readily apparent, allowing stakeholders to identify inflection points and anomalies. This visual aid is instrumental for both strategic planning and communicating complex economic dynamics.

In conclusion, the Annual Tab serves as a comprehensive platform for trend analysis, providing stakeholders with key insights into economic indicators over the years. The highlighted indicators offer a starting point for in-depth investigations and strategic decision-making in areas such as employment, investment, and trade policy.
