This powerful tool not only encapsulates the current financial status but also provides a historical context, allowing users to delve into data dating back to 2010. The data presented here is crucial for understanding the intricate web of economic indicators that shape our daily lives. At the forefront of this dashboard are the Year to Date (YTD) figures, offering a real-time snapshot of key indicators that hold sway over our everyday experiences. These include the Exchange Rate, Petrol Price, Repo Rate, and Consumer Price Index. These metrics serve as vital benchmarks, influencing everything from our purchasing power to the cost of living. Delving deeper, the dashboard unfolds a visual narrative through graphs, portraying the quarterly performance of pivotal economic indicators. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), providing a macroscopic view of the overall economic health. Alongside, the Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) sheds light on the various components of spending within the economy. The Unemployment Rate, a critical socio-economic metric, finds its representation in these graphs, offering insights into the labor market dynamics. Furthermore, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) graph delineates the trends in investments made by businesses and the government, a key determinant of long-term economic growth.

The monthly tab shows the performance of some of the economic indicators highlited in the first tab. We can see the performance from January to June. Most of these indicators show small increases over time, showing gradual changes in the economy. But here's the interesting part: May stands out because it's the month where three important things hit their highest points â€“ the Exchange Rate, Petrol Price, and Repo Rate. The Exchange Rate tells us how strong our money is, and it's at its highest in May. The Petrol Price, which is connected to global oil prices, also reaches its peak during this month. The Repo Rate, a tool used by central banks to influence the economy, follows the same trend by hitting its highest point in May. 

Now, the big question is: Is there a connection between these three things? Does one affect the other? Investigating this could help us understand more about how our economy works. Since this picture only focuses on one year, when we filter for other years to see the trend, it is evident that May is not the problem but these fluncuations occur in any given month. This interesting situation in May invites experts to look closer and figure out if there's a reason behind these peaks. Is it just a coincidence, or is there a real relationship between the Exchange Rate, Petrol Price, and Repo Rate? Finding out could give us a better grasp of how our economy functions and help us be ready for future changes.
