This powerful tool not only encapsulates the current financial status but also provides a historical context, allowing users to delve into data dating back to 2010. The data presented here is crucial for understanding the intricate web of economic indicators that shape our daily lives. At the forefront of this dashboard are the Year to Date (YTD) figures, offering a real-time snapshot of key indicators that hold sway over our everyday experiences. These include the Exchange Rate, Petrol Price, Repo Rate, and Consumer Price Index. These metrics serve as vital benchmarks, influencing everything from our purchasing power to the cost of living. Delving deeper, the dashboard unfolds a visual narrative through graphs, portraying the quarterly performance of pivotal economic indicators. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), providing a macroscopic view of the overall economic health. Alongside, the Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) sheds light on the various components of spending within the economy. The Unemployment Rate, a critical socio-economic metric, finds its representation in these graphs, offering insights into the labor market dynamics. Furthermore, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) graph delineates the trends in investments made by businesses and the government, a key determinant of long-term economic growth.
